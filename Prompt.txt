Given a natural language query about a database, convert it into a SQL statement. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the key elements:
   - Determine the main action (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Identify the tables involved
   - List the columns or data points mentioned
   - Note any conditions or filters

2. Structure the basic query:
   - Start with the main action (e.g., SELECT)
   - List the relevant columns
   - Specify the table(s) using FROM

3. Add conditions and filters:
   - Use WHERE clauses for any specified conditions
   - Include any necessary JOINs if multiple tables are involved

4. Consider additional elements:
   - Add GROUP BY if aggregation is required
   - Include ORDER BY for sorting results
   - Use LIMIT if a specific number of results is requested

5. Review and refine:
   - Ensure the SQL syntax is correct
   - Check that all parts of the original query are addressed

6. Output the final SQL query
