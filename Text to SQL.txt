# Text to SQL Query Generator

def generate_sql_query(schema: str, user_query: str):
    """
    Analyze the user query and generate the appropriate SQL query based on the given schema.
    
    Schema:
    {schema}
    
    User Query: "{user_query}"
    
    Follow these steps to generate the SQL query:
    1. Understand: Interpret the user's request and identify the required SQL operation(s)
    2. Identify: Determine the relevant tables and columns from the schema
    3. Structure: Plan the basic structure of the SQL query
    4. Detail: Add specific clauses (WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.) as needed
    5. Optimize: Refine the query for better performance if possible
    6. Validate: Ensure the query is syntactically correct and logically sound
    """

    # Step 1: Understand the user's request
    # Analyze the user query to determine what kind of information they're looking for
    # and what SQL operations will be required (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)

    # Step 2: Identify relevant schema elements
    # List the tables and columns from the schema that are needed to fulfill the user's request

    # Step 3: Structure the basic query
    # Outline the main components of the SQL query (SELECT, FROM, etc.)

    # Step 4: Add detailed clauses
    # Incorporate necessary clauses such as WHERE for filtering, JOINs for combining tables,
    # GROUP BY for aggregations, etc.

    # Step 5: Optimize the query
    # Review the query for potential optimizations, such as using appropriate indexes,
    # avoiding unnecessary JOINs, or simplifying complex conditions

    # Step 6: Validate the query
    # Double-check that the query is correctly formed and will produce the desired results

    # Final SQL Query
